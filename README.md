# Highly Available and Auto-Scalable WordPress Cluster

Out-of-the-box automated WordPress Cluster solution for large businesses and mission-critical sites


## WordPress Cluster Topology

Upon the package installation, a new environment with the following topology will be created: 
* **NGINX** load balancers are used for distributing the incoming traffic within a cluster
* the WordPress application itself is handled by **NGINX PHP** servers with preconfigured [automatic horizontal scaling](https://docs.jelastic.com/automatic-horizontal-scaling) to handle load spikes
* Highly-available **[MySQL DB Cluster](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/mysql-cluster)** is used to store and operate user data
* **[Data Storage](https://docs.jelastic.com/data-storage-container)** is mounted to all application server nodes for sharing common data
